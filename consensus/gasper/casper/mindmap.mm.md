# Casper FFG in Ethereum Consensus
## Role
- Finality Gadget
    - Provides strong, irreversible guarantees for blocks
## Key Concepts
- ### Proof of Stake (PoS)
    - Consensus mechanism
    - Replaces Proof of Work (PoW)
    - Validators
        - Stake ETH as collateral (min 32 ETH)
        - Selected to propose/attest blocks
    - Incentives
        - Rewards for honest participation
    - Penalties (Slashing)
        - Loss of staked ETH for malicious behavior
        - Prevents double finality votes, surrounding votes
- ### Beacon Chain (Consensus Layer)
    - Coordinates validators
    - Manages staking
    - Processes attestations and FFG votes
- ### Epochs
    - Time periods on the Beacon Chain
    - Each epoch = 32 slots (approx. 6.4 minutes)
    - FFG votes occur at epoch boundaries
- ### Justification
    - A block is "justified" when 2/3+ of the *total staked ETH* votes for it
    - Strong economic agreement on a block's validity
    - Achieved on epoch boundary blocks
- ### Finalization
    - A justified block becomes "finalized" when the *next* epoch's starting block is also justified
    - Considered irreversible and immutable
    - Crucial for transaction certainty
## How it Works (Simplified Flow)
- Validators stake ETH to join network
- Per Slot (12 seconds)
    - Validator proposes block (from Execution Layer)
    - Other validators attest to block (LMD GHOST)
- Per Epoch (32 slots)
    - Validators cast FFG votes for source and target epoch boundary blocks
    - Beacon Chain aggregates votes
    - If 2/3+ stake votes for target block, it becomes JUSTIFIED
    - If a block is justified AND its successor is justified, the first block (and its epoch) becomes FINALIZED
## Benefits
- Enhanced Security
    - Strong finality prevents chain reorganizations
- Economic Security
    - Misbehavior is economically prohibitive (slashing)
- Energy Efficiency
    - Significantly less energy consumption compared to PoW
- Scalability Foundation
    - Enables future scaling solutions like sharding
